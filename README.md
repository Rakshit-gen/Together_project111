## Together Project 111

I created an event lister using ReactJs. It uses a json file called events.json to store details of events like their id, name, location etc and then I used another file fetch them and to seperate them on the basis of their dates of occurence. They are then displayed as cards on the mainpage.

## How to use

Just clone the repo and then do 
### 'cd Together_project111'

then run 
### 'npm i'
and with this you are good to go.

Use ### 'npm start' to run the project
